Web scraper created for a freelance job that fell through. Would grab all the mobile home lot listings from a website, intend to use income records to perform analysis on the correlations between income and mobile home capacity on a town (ZIP code) level.

The SQLite database I'm using to store the information scraped from the mobilehomeparkstore.com website, as well as income records retrieved from the IRS website and a thirdparty ZIP code table, is not provided due to file size constraints.

Currently, the scripts provided only scrape the website and clean up the data retrieved once its stored in the database to allow for analysis of the data. An updated version with my analysis will be provided in the coming days/weeks, as I finish writing the code for it.
